This is a basic example of a TeamCity build configuration for Salesforce Sandbox Refresh. Here are some key points to consider:

In the VCS settings, configure the connection to your Salesforce project's version control system, typically Git.

The Authenticate with Salesforce step uses the Salesforce CLI to log in to your Salesforce org. Replace my-sandbox-alias with your Salesforce alias and specify the correct Salesforce login URL (sandbox or production).

The Refresh Salesforce Sandbox step uses the sfdx force:org:refresh command to refresh the sandbox. Replace sandboxName with the name of the sandbox you want to refresh.

Configure build triggers and dependencies based on your CI/CD pipeline requirements.

Make sure to configure your TeamCity build agent with Salesforce CLI and the necessary environment variables for authentication.

This example assumes you are using Salesforce DX. Adjust the script content and commands according to your specific Salesforce deployment process.

Remember that you need to adapt this configuration to your organization's Salesforce environment and CI/CD pipeline. Be sure to follow best practices for secure handling of credentials and secrets in your build process.
